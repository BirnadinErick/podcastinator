# Podcastinator

Hey there, hello here from Jaffna üëã. This is a fairly dead-simple
shower thought I had. I wanna make clear that there **are** many better
alternate solutions, but I wanted to do mine. So here comes a terminal based 
podcast player focused for developers. 

### Features

Podcastinator has following features:-
 * TUI: Terminal User Interface
 * Cross-platform: runs anywhere where python can run and with an active internet connection
 * Simple Interface
 * Offline Playback


## About Podcastinator

### Just, Why?

#### Why a podcast player?
I always wanted to listen to podcasts/music while I code. But most of the time, I spend time
with physical servers with no-gui; sometimes my decade-old laptop may run mem-hoggy tasks and 
opening up Spotify/Web browser then an audio playback is just down-right expensive, eventhough 
I decided to do so the playback SUCKSüòí. 

#### Why TUI?
So I decided to create my own playback engine with less-resource footprint. **Hence**, TUI. Most of
the resources other podcast players may(I dunno for sureü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I assume) use for fancy animations 
and god-tier UIs. I strongly hope that TUI will let me have podcasts even when I am in server ttys 
or have very less resources!

#### Conclusion
I hope this pays out well. I just had to hope for the best and wait till it all falls together and
see what HAVE I DONE?
